# LMSWebService

A simple HTTP web service built with Python.

## Requirements

docker build -t myapp:test .
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 myapp:test
```

Or use the Makefile commands:

```bash
make build    # Build the image
make run_all  # Start containers
make down     # Stop containers
```

## Development

Format code:

```bash
make format
```

Check code:

```bash
make check
```

## API
